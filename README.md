## SELL IT. UX Design Project by Sebastien Dills
### Introduction
My DH 150 project analyzes and improves upon several vintage and re-sale apps such as Depop and Etsy. I chose to evaluate Depop because of its limited use of filters and catered content, as well as a lack of authentication on goods sold. Etsy's website and app are overly cluttered and difficult to navigate. Etsy also fails to have a product identification and verification process so it is cluttered with non-used goods and drop shippers falsely advertising products. My app attempts to remedy this by having each item reviewed to ensure it is authentic and honestly listed as well as providing price recommendations to both sellers and buyers. SELL IT also has mandatory filters on each item to make it easier to categorize. Finally, the app is focused on local selling and buying to avoid the unnecessary impact overnight shipping has on the environment, as well as form connections in local communities. 

### Design Statement
Much of the design issues with other apps comes down to a lack of information. On Depop and Etsy you can't always see where a seller is located or an item would be shipped out from. On my app that is a central feature. Being able to sort/search by location is essential for sustainable fashion to be truly sustainable. In addition to this, having added authentication steps (such as requiring pictures to be taken from within the app) ensure that items aren't being dropshipped. The app I designed needed to have all these features while maintaining a simple and easily navigatable design. Having items be required to have as much information as possible and using a similar system as StockX of showing what a fair price would be is also important. For the price rating to work, the items need to be well cataloged. In this sense, both of these design choices are interlocked. 

### Competitor Analysis and Heuristic Evaluation
In order to learn more about other vintage e-commerce websites, I conducted heuristic evaluations for Depop.com and Etsy.com. I chose to analyze these two websites because they represent the standard in selling used online and also face a lot of the same issues in terms of product information and authentication. In terms of their weakness in design, I found them to be the opposite. Etsy was overcluttered has confusing labels and was overall very difficult to navigate and figure out what different sections even meant. Depop on the other hand was very lacking in terms of its website. They were no filters or categories at all. For my project, I realized I wanted to focus on adding more detailed tags on items while focusing on local selling/buying. For the design, I wanted to split the difference between these two sites and find a nice balance between Depop's barren look and Etsy's overly cluttered appearance. 

After my heuristic evaluation, I conducted a usability test with a user with little to no experience on the site. What I found was that the user had a difficult time with the naming conventions used by Etsy.com. I also realized that sticking to similar style choices as most e-commerce sites is important as it makes new users feel familiar and comfortable with your platform.

### Contextual Inquiry 
Following the heuristic evaluation and usability test, I engaged in a broader examination of how people shop for clothes and why they make the decision they do. I interviewed a 19-year-old college female. The goal was to find out why or why not she buys used and vintage clothes, where she commonly shops, if she prefers retail stores or e-commerce. All of this was meant to give me more information on how to optimize my end goal of having a working prototype of my vintage clothing website. From my contextual inquiry, I learned that many users are somewhat apathetic when it comes to buying their clothes and prioritize product satisfaction and ease when making choices. Knowing this I felt like the authentification process would be an important part of my app design. The participant felt like used clothes are dirty and ragged. Having a third-party examine, price, and authenticate items ensures that users are more confident in their purchases. Returns are also uncommon when it comes to buying used and independent, so ensuring quality is extremely important. Also having an interface that makes it easy to sort and search for items is important for users who aren't familiar with vintage clothes and might not have an idea of what they are looking for. The participant in the contextual inquiry said that she often browses and looks for items in stores without going into the experience with clear expectations.

### UX Storytelling: Personas, Journey Maps, Scenarios
Based on all my prior information I gathered I designed two different user personas and scenarios. These were meant to embody two kinds of different people who might use the app and the sorts of interactions they might have on it. Megan represented a younger user who is college-aged. I modeled a lot of what she embodied based on the conversations I had in the contextual inquiry and usability test. Her main goals were to spend her money more responsibly/ethically and expand her wardrobe. Megan is an example of someone who might benefit from clearer categories and catered content on the app. Being able to more easily find stuff she likes rather than sift through hundreds of listings makes her life much easier. Christine represented an older user both looking to buy clothes for her kids as well as sell her older stuff she has lying around her house. Christine was a good example of someone who might benefit from location-based selling and pricing recommendations. Being able to avoid having to package and ship items save her time and money, and pricing recommendations makes sure she is getting a fair price.

### Wireframe Low-Fidelity Prototypes
To begin designing my initial wireframes and low-fidelity prototype, I downloaded a bunch of retail apps on my phone to study their designs. I wanted to stick to a familiar format. I knew the basic design structure I wanted to cover and the 3 main actions I wanted to include. These were specifically having a map/location-based search function (most likely a map), detailed descriptions and categories on all items, and adding listings within the app (camera included). Putting myself in the mindset that I would need to interact with the pieces of paper like an app made the process much easier. Thinking intuitively through the whole time of this project made a big difference. After designing the basic wireframes and wireflow connecting these actions I conducted a user pathway test. This went very smoothly and the participant quickly understood the point of the activity.

### Low-Fidelity Prototypes

After designing the basic wireframes and wireflow connecting these actions I conducted a user pathway test. This went very smoothly and the participant quickly understood the point of the activity. You can find a video of the user pathway test at the link below. A screenshot of my original wireflow is also shown below. It helped me look at how a new user might interact with my platform. The only thing I realized (which is out of the score of my activity) is how to connect with a user and make them understand why our product is better for them not just in terms of products and design. I was curious about how to show them how the additional steps my program mandates help them in the long run.

### High Fidelity Prototype
Now that I was done with the low fidelity prototype, it was time to move on and try to make an interactive model. I tried to make my project seem professional and legitimate by using familiar icons (emojis) but this didn't work as intended. My design seemed un-realistic and had blank boxes making it still seem "low-fidelity". My color choices and image selection were also generally poor. I also made some mistakes while optimizing for the screen I opted to use. Below I've added screenshots of my first draft for the high fidelity prototype.

Upon receiving feedback from my professor I restarted the process by reworking the "home" screen to feel more real and appropriate and then worked from this point. I also wanted to add more functions, such as favoriting an item. In addition to this, I wanted to restrict the movement between screens so that there aren't any logical issues. For example prior you were able to access the cart without first having added an item to it. Removing mistakes such as these make my prototype feel more real. I also added more colors out of the color palette I chose, used standardized icons for a more professional feel, and changed the spacing between icons to remove clutter. 

The final version of my high fiedlity prototype supports these following tasks:
1) List items with an in-app camera in order to maintain authenticity.

2) Search and categorize items via brand, year etc with detailed and manditory tags on every item.

3) Have price ranking system to show what percent value you are getting at a certain price.

4) Have an interactive map to find local listings and filter by distance/area.

### Video Pitch

### Conclusion 
I am very satisfied with the growth and learning from this class and project. When I first looked at what the final project was meant to be I was overwhelmed at the idea, but I feel like everything was well-formatted and followed a logical progression that never made it feel like I was taking any big leaps. I am happy to have gotten some experience using Figma, I can see the carryover into my professional life as a good hard skill to have in my arsenal. The most enlightening parts of this class in my opinion were learning to criticize websites and demand more from out system-user interactions. Knowing what is poor design is the most critical part of being able to create a good design. I have found myself being more analytical and thoughtful when I engage and use online materials. I think I've learned to ask myself questions about the design of websites and be cynical of negative practices. I enjoyed the website critiques and all the opportunities I had to collect data from test subjects. I never knew so much went into web design and UI/UX as a whole. Overall this class was very educational and has carried over both in my professional aspirations and my everyday media interactions.
