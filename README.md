## SELL IT. UX Design Project by Sebastien Dills
### Introduction
My DH 150 project analyzes and improves upon several vintage and re-sale apps such as Depop and Etsy. I chose to evaluate Depop because of it's limited use of filters and catered content, as well as a lack of authentication on goods sold. Etsy's website and app are overly cluttered and difficult to navigate. Etsy also fails to have a product identification and verification process so it is cluttered with non-used goods and dropshipers falsely advertising products. My app attempts to rememedy this by having each item reviewed to ensure it is authetnic and honestly listed as well as providing price recommendations to both sellers and buyers. SELL IT also has manditroy filters on each item to make them easier to categorize. Fianlly the app is focused on local sellign and buying to avoid the unesseary impact overnight shipping has on the enviornemtn, as well as form connections in local communties. 

### Design Statement
Much of the design issues with other apps comes down to lack of information. On Depop and Etsy you can't always see where a seller is located or an item would be shipped out from. On my app that is a central feature. Being able to sort/search by location is essential for sustainble fashion to be truely sustainable. In addition to this having added authentication steps such as requring pictures to be taken from within the app ensure that items aren't being dropshipped. The app I designed needed to have all these features while maintaining a simple and easily navigatable design. Having items be required to have as much information as possible and using a similar system as StockX of showing what a fair price would be is also important. In order for the price rating to work the items need to be well catalogued. In this sense both of these design choices are interlocked. 

### Competitor Analysis and Heuristic Evaluation
In order to learn more about other vintage e-commerce websites I comducted heuristic evaluations for Depop.com and Etsy.com. I chose to analyze these two websites becuase the represent the standard in selling used online and also face a lot of the same issues in terms of product information and authentication. In terms of their weakness in design I found them to be opposite. Etsy was overcluttered has confusing lables and was overall very difficult to naviaget and figure out what different sections even meant. Depop on the other hand was very lakcing in terms of its website. They were no filters or categories at all. For my project I realized I wanted to focus on adding more detailed tags on items while focusing on local selling/buying. For the design I wanted to split the different between these two sites and find a nice blaance between Depop's barren look and Etsy's overly cluttered appearance. 

After my heurisitc evaluation I conducted a usablity test with a user with little to no exprience on the site. What I found was that the user had a difficult time with the naming conventions used by Etsy.com. I also realized that sticking to similar style choices as most e-commerce sites is important as it makes new users feel familiar and comfertable with you platform.

### Contextual Inquiry 
Following the heuristic evaluation and usablity test I engaged in a broader examination of how people shop for clothes and why they make the decision they do. I interviewed a 19 year old college female. The goal was to find out why or why not she buys used and vintage clothes, where she commonly shops, if she prefers retail stores or e-commerce. All of this was meant to give me more information on how to optimize my end goal of having a working prototype of my vintage clothing website. From my contextual inquiry I learned that mnay users are somwhat apathetic when it comes to buying their clothes and prioritize product satisfaction and ease when making choices. Knowing this I felt like the authentification process would be an important part of my app design. The participant felt like used clothes are dirty and raged. Having a third-party examine, price and authenticate items ensures that user are more confident in their purchases. Returns are also uncommon when it comes to buying used and independant, so ensuring quality is extreemly important. Also having an interface that makes it easy to sort and search for items is important for users who aren't familiar with vintage clothes and might not have an idea of what they are looking for. The participant in the contextual inquiry said that she often browses and looks for items in stores without going into the exprience with clear expectations.

### UX Storytelling: Personas, Journey Maps, Scenarios
Based on all my prior information I gathered I designed two different user personas and scenarios. These were meant to embody two kinds of different people who might use the app and the sorts of interactions they might have on it. Megan represented a younger user who is college aged. I modeled a lot of what she embodied based on the conversations I had in the contextual inquiry and usability test. Her main goals were to spend her money more responsibly/ethically and expand her wardrobe. Megan is an exmaple of someone who might benefit from clearer categories and catered content on the app. Being able to more easily find stuff she likes rather than sift through hundreds of listings makes her life much easier. Christine represented an older user both looking to buy clothes for her kids as well as sell her older stuff she has lying around her house. Christine was a good example of someone who might benefit from the location based selling and pricing recommendations. Being able to avoid having to package and ship items saves her time and money, and pricing recommendations makes sure she is getting a fair price.
